# building-a-portfolio
I'll be using this repository to develop my personal portfolio and track changes to it
Hello there! 
This is my personal portfolio webpage which can be accessed at nenadmarkovic.tech
I am using this to practice my Git skills and track changes, as I've come to understand that saving different versions of your code in different files is extremely inefficient.
Working on a first complex project (complex for me as a beginner :D) made me realize the value of Git control, so here I am again! 
Feel free to use my code to build your own portfolio webpage! ^_^
